# We'll now take a look at basic input handling! This program we'll make the user have to input two numbers and we will multiply them!
num1 = input("Enter your first number: ")#We've already learned this, but now we're setting different variables. Like in this case we're using 'num1'
#^ instead of foo like the last one
num2 = input("Enter your second number: ")
#We can have a variable solve the question, then print the variable like so:
answer = num1 * num2 # '*' is the equivalent to the multiplication symbol in math!
#answer will now be what num1 times num2 is!
print(answer) #and now we print it! This will print the answer to num1 * num2!!
