### You got this - Keep pushing to be better and you'll always surpass your previous expectations
Do NOT be discouraged by failing code. [Here](https://github.com/dev-nolant/C-Temp-Server) is one of my more advanced yet simple codes that fails like 50% of the time. (May be fixed by time seeing this) -- But point being, everyone makes errors and mistakes, grow and learn from them. That is how you get better and become the best.

##‘python’ is not recognized as an internal or external command
>> You will need to add Python to your System Environment on your computer! Sounds a lot harder than it actually is. Here is a [website](https://datatofish.com/add-python-to-windows-path/) that will help you out!
##What is your favorite IDE(integrated development environment)?
>> My favorite depends on which language I'm programming in! I mostly use VSC([Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)), but for other things I use JetBrains, [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/). Some help you more in different ways, so find what best suits you!
##What projects will we be doing?
>> My goal is to get a wide range of projects in! From simple math calculating projects to advanced server requests! Maybe even make a game(not just snake </3, a cool sudoku solver or maybe a game of your choice!) - We're sure to have fun
